The purpose of this repository is to provide applications and services for the Built With Sciences Community.

## MVP
*Things we absolutely need for "release".*
- Basic profile and account settings
  - Front end profile design/account settings
  - Authentication
  - API to store and retrieve user data
- View workouts in their PDF forms

## Contributing
Each sub-bullet point is essentially its own task.
If you'd like to work on a task, feel free to prepend your name and date picked up in this README (E.G. [David 1/1/21] - design X for Y feature). Once finished, feel free to strike through the text to mark it as complete (E.G. ~~[David 1/1/21] - design X for Y feature~~). This way we can see what has and hasn't been worked on yet.
